## 1. Overview
In this section provides a brief overview of the business problem.  By brief, it should include a single image (business process or use case diagram) and a textual explanation (describing actors, tasks, information, or outcomes) and described in *Step 4*.

The process we are dealing with here is clearly not as simple as you might be led on to believe. We are dealing with at least 3 different parties here. I interviewed a number of people, some of whom had good insights, others of whom weren’t very helpful. One person suggested bringing drones into the picture. For the sake of simplicity (and not wanting to think about legal complications) I decided against bringing drones into any part of this. 

As far as I can boil this down, we have a) an individual ordering food and specifying delivery instructions, b) the food is then prepared by a food service employee, and c) a delivery person will then come and get the food, bringing it to the person that ordered it. 

## 2. Requirements


#### Business: 
Add convenience to student’s lives.
Be reliable and well coordinated.
Food needs to reach customer in a reasonable time. 
Delivery menu must be catered specifically for items that can be reasonably transported.

#### User:
Customer must be able to specify delivery instructions. 

#### Functional:
1. Customer must be charged upon placing their order
Cook needs to be notified of order.
2. Delivery person needs to be notified when order is placed.
Estimated time of pickup should be provided to delivery person.

3. Delivery People must be employees working for the food on campus provider. If workers are random people picking up orders they will likely not be available when needed.  

#### Non-Functional:
1. Must be easy to use, and have simple options. 
2. Limit of order size (so that delivery person only has to make one trip).


#### System: 
1. Should be a mobile app.


## 3. Assumptions
This is an optional section, where system constraints, out of scope features or other caveats can be clearly documented.
